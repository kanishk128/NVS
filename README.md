Project on Metro Network System
A metro network consists of many stations and various routes. Its difficult for the consumer to decide which route is cost-effective as well as time-saving. For help, a person may need to go to the helpdesk or ask another person making the process tiring and troublesome; and more resource needy for the metro corporation. 

To solve the above problem, we have implemented a C++ program based on graphs and other concepts. The consumer can easily get help from it, by entering the source and destination stations, after which the program will display the details of the shortest path. The individual can effortlessly interact with the program and there will be no need of extra personnel.

The above program can be incorporated by any metro corporation for easy, efficient and fast calculation of the best route possible between two station; for the convenience of its consumers. Similar approach can also be used in creating a navigation system, or delivery chain management helper.
It can also come in aid in networking, especially social networking because graph is used by social network giants and the Dijkstra algorithm will prove trustworthy in the transfer of data and information across the network.
